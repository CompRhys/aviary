# Wyckoff - Embeddings

## bra-alg-off

A 6 + 5 + 185 + 248 dimension embedding of the crystal system, unit cell centering, the sum of whether sites
in a wyckoff position sit on lines, planes or in volumes, and the specific offset of that wyckoff position within
the unit cell.

## spg-alg-off

A 230 + 185 + 248 dimension embedding consisting of a OHE of the spacegroup, the sum of whether sites
in a wyckoff position sit on lines, planes or in volumes, and the specific offset of that wyckoff position within
the unit cell.
