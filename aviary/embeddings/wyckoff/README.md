# Wyckoff Position Embeddings

## bra-alg-off

A 6 + 5 + 185 + 248 = 444 dimensional embedding encoding

- the crystal system
- unit cell centering
- the sum of whether sites in a wyckoff position sit on lines, planes or in volumes
- the specific offset of that wyckoff position within the unit cell

## spg-alg-off

A 230 + 185 + 248 = 663 dimensional embedding consisting of

- a OHE of the spacegroup
- the sum of whether sites in a wyckoff position sit on lines, planes or in volumes
- the specific offset of that wyckoff position within the unit cell
