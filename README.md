</h4>

The aviary contains `roost`, `wren` and `cgcnn`. The aim is to contain multiple models for materials discovery under a common interface

## Environment Setup

To use `aviary` you need to create an environment with the correct dependencies. The easiest way to get up and running is to use `anaconda`.
A `cudatoolkit=11.1` environment file is provided `environment-gpu-cu111.yml` allowing a working environment to be created with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-gpu-cu111.yml
```

If you are not using `cudatoolkit=11.1` or do not have access to a GPU this setup will not work for you. If so please check the following pages [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), [PyTorch-Scatter](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) for how to install the core packages and then install the remaining requirements as detailed in `requirements.txt`.

The code was developed and tested on Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa. The code should work with other Operating Systems but it has not been tested for such use.

## Aviary Setup

Once you have set up an environment with the correct dependencies you can install `aviary` using the following commands from the top of the directory:

```bash
conda activate aviary
python setup.py sdist
pip install -e .
```

This will install the library in an editable state allowing for advanced users to make changes as desired.

## Example Use

To test the input files generation and cleaning/canonicalization please run:

```sh
python examples/inputs/poscar2df.py
```

This script will load and parse a subset of raw POSCAR files from the TAATA dataset and produce the `datasets/examples/examples.csv` file used for the next example.
The raw files have been selected to ensure that the subset contains all the correct endpoints for the 5 elemental species in the `Hf-N-Ti-Zr-Zn` chemical system.
All the models used share can be run on the input file produced by this example code. To test each of the three models provided please run:

```sh
python examples/roost.py --train --evaluate --data-path datasets/examples/examples.csv --targets E_f --tasks regression --losses L1 --robust --epoch 10
```
```sh
python examples/wren.py --train --evaluate --data-path datasets/examples/examples.csv --targets E_f --tasks regression --losses L1 --robust --epoch 10
```
```sh
python examples/cgcnn.py --train --evaluate --data-path datasets/examples/examples.csv --targets E_f --tasks regression --losses L1 --robust --epoch 10
```

Please note that for speed/demonstration purposes this example runs on only ~68 materials for 10 epochs - running all these examples should take < 30s. These examples do not have sufficient data or training to make accurate predictions, however, the same scripts have been used for all experiments conducted.

## Disclaimer

This research code is provided as-is. We have checked for potential bugs and believe that the code is being shared in a bug-free state. As this is an archive version we will not be able to amend the code to fix bugs/edge-cases found at a later date. However, this code will likely continue to be developed at the location described in the metadata.
